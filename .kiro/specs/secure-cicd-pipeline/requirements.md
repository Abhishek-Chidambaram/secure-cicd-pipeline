# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive secure CI/CD pipeline that integrates multiple security scanning tools, vulnerability management, and secure deployment processes. The pipeline will automatically scan code, dependencies, and container images for security vulnerabilities while maintaining compliance with security best practices throughout the development lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated security scanning integrated into my CI/CD pipeline, so that vulnerabilities are detected early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN the system SHALL trigger automated security scans
2. WHEN dependency vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL fail the build if high or critical vulnerabilities are found
3. WHEN security scans complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports with vulnerability details and remediation guidance
4. IF no critical vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL allow the pipeline to proceed to the next stage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive vulnerability scanning across multiple layers, so that all potential security risks are identified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning is initiated THEN the system SHALL scan Python dependencies using Snyk
2. WHEN Docker images are built THEN the system SHALL scan container images for vulnerabilities
3. WHEN source code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL perform static application security testing (SAST)
4. WHEN third-party components are detected THEN the system SHALL check for known vulnerabilities in all dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want secure secret management in the CI/CD pipeline, so that sensitive information is protected throughout the deployment process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN secrets are needed THEN the system SHALL retrieve them from secure secret stores only
2. WHEN pipeline logs are generated THEN the system SHALL mask all sensitive information
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use secure token-based authentication
4. IF secrets are detected in code THEN the system SHALL fail the build and alert security teams

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want audit trails and security reporting, so that we can demonstrate compliance with security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security scans complete THEN the system SHALL generate compliance reports
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL track remediation status
3. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL log all security-related activities
4. IF compliance violations are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify stakeholders

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated security testing in different environments, so that security is validated throughout the deployment pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code reaches staging THEN the system SHALL perform dynamic security testing
2. WHEN containers are deployed THEN the system SHALL validate runtime security configurations
3. WHEN infrastructure changes are made THEN the system SHALL scan infrastructure as code for security misconfigurations
4. IF security tests fail THEN the system SHALL rollback deployments automatically
